**Adding a new Community Member**
- Adding a new profile is an act of recognition of consistent contribution to Layer5 project(s).
- The consistency by which a member contributes (their activity in the community) may ebb and flow organically as their availability to spend time doing so comes and goes.
- Profile status should reflect the Active vs Inactive status of their current community involvement.
